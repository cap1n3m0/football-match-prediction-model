# Football Match Prediction using Machine Learning Model 
This project leverages the power of machine learning to predict the outcomes of football matches in the English Premier League (EPL). By analyzing historical match data obtained through web scraping, we aim to develop a predictive model using the random forest classifier algorithm. The goal is to enhance the accuracy of match outcome predictions, providing valuable insights for sports analysts, bettors, and football enthusiasts.

## Project Steps are as follows:

### Step-1: Scrape Match Data
#### Tools Used: requests, BeautifulSoup, pandas
Description: The project begins with the collection of historical match data from reputable sports websites. Using web scraping tools like requests and BeautifulSoup, we will extract key details such as team names, match dates, scores, and other relevant statistics. This data will be organized and stored in pandas DataFrames for efficient analysis and processing.

### Step-2: Clean the Data
#### Tools Used: pandas
Description: Raw data often contains inconsistencies and missing values that need to be addressed before it can be used for machine learning. In this step, we will clean and preprocess the data using pandas. This involves handling missing values, converting data types, normalizing numerical features, and creating additional features such as recent team performance metrics and home/away advantages to enhance the predictive power of our model.

### Step-3: Make Predictions Using Random Forest Classifier
#### Tools Used: scikit-learn
Description: With the cleaned dataset, we will employ the RandomForestClassifier from the scikit-learn library to predict match outcomes. This involves training the model on historical match data to learn patterns and relationships that influence match results. The trained model will then be used to make predictions on future matches, providing insights into potential winners.

### Step-4: Measure Error and Improve Predictions
#### Tools Used: scikit-learn
Description: The final step focuses on evaluating the model's performance and refining its accuracy. We will assess the model using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Based on the evaluation results, we will iteratively improve the model through techniques like hyperparameter tuning, feature engineering, and ensemble methods to enhance its predictive capabilities.

## Potential Enhancements
1. Advanced Metrics: Incorporate more advanced metrics such as player statistics, injury reports, and weather conditions on match day.
2. Recent Form: Calculate and include features that capture the recent form of the teams, such as points earned in the last 5 matches.
3. Head-to-Head Statistics: Include historical head-to-head performance metrics between teams.
4. Interactive Dashboard: Develop an interactive web-based dashboard. This can allow users to input match details and get predictions easily.
5. Multiple Models: Compare the performance of different machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, SVM, neural networks) to determine the best approach for the prediction task.
